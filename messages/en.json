    "paragraph1": "At Muxu Cheesecakes we believe life's best moments happen around a table: during an endless after-dinner chat, an impromptu afternoon tea with friends, a family celebration, or a kiss with your partner after dessert. That's why our cakes are more than cheesecakes… they're little stories of love, warmth and togetherness.",
    "paragraph2": "\"Muxu\" means kiss in Basque, the origin of our original cheesecake recipe, and it's what we strive to share with every creation: a sweet gesture that comforts, accompanies and brings people together.",
    "paragraph3": "We know how important it is for the experience to be perfect from start to finish. That's why we offer home delivery, taking care of every detail so your cheesecake arrives in perfect condition—fresh, beautiful and ready to delight from the very first bite. Convenience and quality are essential to us: we want you to focus only on enjoying.",
    "paragraph4": "At Muxu Cheesecakes we bake sweetness, deliver warmth and celebrate the moments that truly matter.",
